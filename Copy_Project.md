QUESTION

How do I copy an existing ÂµVision project so that an identical project with a different name is created?
ANSWER

    Copy the existing project files into the new folder.
    Rename the following files according to the new project name.
        - .uvproj
        - .uvopt
        - .uvgui
          (Please note: handling former uV2-projects just requires renaming the file .uv2)
    Enter the new project name at:
     Options For Target, Output tab, Name of Executable
